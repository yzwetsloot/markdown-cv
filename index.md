## Technical experience

### Projects

`2019 - now`
**MultiScrape**<br>
Web scraper framework which allows for easy deployment of new crawlers for various online retailers. It takes care of the common tasks like database interaction, handling proxies, providing notifications and request concurrency. Its object-oriented design allows for the implementation of retailer-specific behaviour.<br>
Currently in use to maintain and develop the various web scrapers at <em class="emph">Megabricks</em>.

`May 2020 - Jul 2020`
**Extending support for cryptocurrencies in a<br> blockchain-based decentralized exchange**<br>
Extend support for cryptocurrencies like Iota, Monero and Ethereum in a student team for the decentralized exchange part of the TU Delft-backed <em class="emph">Tribler</em> project.<br>
Link to project: <a href="https://github.com/Tribler/anydex-core/pull/44"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> anydex-core</a><br>

### Programming languages

**Python**<br>
Self-taught in this language to initially develop web scraping applications at <em class="emph">Megabricks</em> using powerful tools like <em class="emph">Numpy</em> and <em class="emph">Pandas</em>. Furthermore, this is my language of choice in developing serverless applications and utility scripts at <em class="emph">inQdo</em>. Lastly, I frequently make use of Python to develop and test trading strategies.<br>

<p class="with-note"><strong>C++</strong></p>
Language of choice when performance and efficiency are important. For example, for hobby projects on my Raspberry Pi or for the development of a ray tracer in a team of 5 students at TU Delft (<a href="https://github.com/jonay2000/raytracing-project"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Ray tracing project</a>).

<p class="with-note"><strong>JavaScript</strong></p>
I use JavaScript to visualize data effectively in web applications, often using React as frontend framework and Node and MongoDB for the backend and database (MERN stack). Its fantastic support for async execution lends it well for use in serverless functions.<br>
<!-- <p class="note">&nbsp;Graaf is a high-performance web scraper for creating and visualizing a&nbsp;serializable graph of the Internet</p> -->

Basic knowledge of SQL, Golang, Java, Kotlin and PHP

### Tools

Microsoft Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Amazon Web Services, Serverless, Docker, Pandas, Numpy, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, React and Node.js
